1. It supports 8-channel circular array with diameter 0.2m, single speaker in noise and reverberant environment. One channel in one wavfile with the format (i.e., "*_ch1.wav"). An example is shown in the "./data" folder.

Remember to revise the input wav part, if your wav is 8 channels in one file. Store them in Int16, as our inputs to network are Int16.

2. If your array is not circular with diameter 0.2m, you need to revise the trueTDOA.m and doa2tdoa.m accordingly.

3. In our example, the true DOA is 135, and the estimation is also 135.
